# In simple terms GIT PULL = Git Fetch + Git Merge

example: on gitHub this file got created (there is no local Fetch-and-Merge.md file

* Git Fetch fetches remote COMMITTED and PUSHED changes without changing local code
command example: git fetch git@github.com:SeanU2022/first-day-repo.git
result: this new file "Fetch-and-Merge" is noted as a change but local repo does not have a copy of the file

* Git Merge combines the remote changes with local changes
