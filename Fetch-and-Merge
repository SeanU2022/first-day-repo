# In simple terms GIT PULL = Git Fetch git@.. + Git Merge ?origin main?

https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository

example: on gitHub this file got created (there is no local Fetch-and-Merge.md file

* Git Fetch fetches remote COMMITTED and PUSHED changes without changing local code
command example: git fetch git@github.com:SeanU2022/first-day-repo.git
result: this new file "Fetch-and-Merge" is noted as a change but local repo does not have a copy of the file

* Git Merge combines the remote changes with local changes
FINISH: 04-Stu_Git/fetch and merge activity
